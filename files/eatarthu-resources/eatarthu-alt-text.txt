EATARTHU
Transcension of the self following the death of magic: Act 4
METAMORPHOSIS | SISOHPROMATEM
SHARP FOURTH



I look out the window
Feicim as an fhuinneog
Anocht,
Tá an solas mícheart
I Try to reground myself

The fool looks out upon the shore
Waves clasping at the sand
crash
Each dreadful lap crumblin her work {	crash
crash 	dissolving(it);
} lost to sea
She shall build another
but not here
not now



EATARTHU
The space between spaces, has been partially discovered
by many. Yet none have take then time to fully realise it. To
transcend beyond, to enter and become intertwined.
EUPHORIC
a new form taken, and held. not hostage. a new form taken,
and held, not living. a new form taken, and held. reborn
Nodes sprawled across a surface, stretching out in the space
between spaces. The gaps in atoms, unoccupied by forces
known to the material, waves, tumbling, spiralling, shaping; the
materia; sculpting its essence.

To enter is a right of passage
To enter is a sacrifice
LEAVE
YOUR
MATERIAL
SELF
BECOME NEW

EATARTHU//EUPHORIC



Dear Diary,

Today I visited a small lough in [REDACTED]. I went alone
as instructed, and tried my best to keep to myself. However
it wasn't an issue as the hills were empty. I settled on the
shore of the lake and after admiring the natural beauty, I
skipped rocks across the lough. The mirror surface briefly
disturbed with each hop, accompanied by a gentle splash.
Ringing out across the secluded depressioni in the hillside;
I felt a serenity I not felt before. As time passed she
appeared above the crest of the hill to the west. Her solemn,
beautiful, chilling, gaze locking with mine.

She rose, inching higher and higher into the sky with each
passing moment. Stunned by her beauty, filled with envy I
knew I must enter the space between spaces.

Brigid,
April 14th

d'eirigh sí agus thosaigh sí ag siúl
over the crest of the hihll.
i stood in awe.

froze
me in place

she grabbed me; leaned in
whispering in my ear so gently
<<compordach, ceart go leor?>>
<<nach bhfuil tú?>>
stammering for a reply
<<bí ciúin, le do thoil>>
tá brón::orm, ta brón[orm]

flushed, i holder her shoulders tight
EUPHORIC
grip tightens as she kisses
{my, neck}
my cloak+mind -> slips;
unraveling, spiralling, permuting

she lays me out,

I misalign,
like sand my physical form
dissolves beneath the waves
METAMORPHOSIS
BEGINS
with a final kiss, she releases
me. ∎




METAMORPHOSIS
I bid farewell to my familiar
